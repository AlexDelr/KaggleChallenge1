# KaggleChallenge1
First Challenge using Kaggle data.

##What:
We selected the Kaggle "Countries of the World" challenge (see: https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world).

##Why:
This looked like a dataset which showed a broad variety of data features, allowing for various data combinations.

##When:
2020-10-27

##How:
Using the methods of the python pandas and matplotlib libraries we created 2 pie charts, a histogram and a scatterplot.

##Who:
This solution was prepared by Jens Coppejans and Alex Delruelle.


##Pending things to do:
- 3D plot
- some more finetuning of the other plots.
