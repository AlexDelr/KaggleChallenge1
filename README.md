# KaggleChallenge1
First Challenge using Kaggle data.

## What:
We selected the Kaggle "[Countries of the World](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world)" challenge.

## Why:
This looked like a dataset which showed a broad variety of data features, allowing for various data combinations.

## When:
2020-10-27

## How:
Using the methods of the python pandas and matplotlib libraries we created 2 pie charts, a histogram and a scatterplot.
There is one [datafile](https://github.com/AlexDelr/KaggleChallenge1/blob/main/countries%20of%20the%20world.csv) and one [Codefile](https://github.com/AlexDelr/KaggleChallenge1/blob/main/CountriesOfTheWorld.ipynb)

## Who:
This solution was prepared by Jens Coppejans and Alex Delruelle.


## Pending things to do:
- 3D plot
- some more finetuning of the other plots.
